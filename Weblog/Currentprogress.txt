as of 7-8 the functionality in the controllers is mostly done, edit and delete etc could do some touch ups or actual checking. login seems to work with reader accounts. 
Things i definately need to do still would include:
- making a profile page for users, and potentially the blog owner too.
- Articles storage
- Article edit
- currently the admin page is like my webshops dashboard. we can simplify that and the workflow for the user. 
- reader userprofile page. (subscriptions, edit user info, liked/favorite articles maybe?)
-                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  

the ideal workflow for the owner would be. sign in and go to their site management page (either through the regular login or their own specific login route)
have a post a new article button
IDEALLY wed end up making like a mini html editor so that the owner can post images wherever they want in their blogpost, this also relies on fixing the storage stuff.
the user can on this new article page also select existing categories to tag this article with, or create new ones.
checkbox for is_premium.
hit post and the article would be posted

theyd have a seperate category management button. this would lead to a page where all current categories are listed and display how many articles are tied to each. 
any category should be deleteable. as they are tied through a junction table this should be possible even if a category is tied to articles (gl figuring out how to do that).
edit is also an option.




Reader workflow. 

home page loads on accessing the page. it should display a few most recent articles. maybe even include premium articles here but only previews.
clicking on an article allows a signed in user to read and post comments below it.  






GPT'ed summary for how the owners dashboard could look like, will adjust once i read through it a few more times:

To enhance the article and category management experience for the poster, integrating category creation and selection directly into the article creation and editing interface 
is a great idea. This approach streamlines the workflow and makes it easier for the user to manage categories without navigating away from the article page. 
Here’s a detailed layout suggestion to achieve this:

Implementation Considerations
Dynamic Category Creation:

Use JavaScript to dynamically add new categories within the article creation/editing form.
Ensure the new categories are saved to the database without requiring a page reload.
Category Selection:

Use checkboxes for selecting and deselecting existing categories.
Display selected categories prominently within the article form.
AJAX Requests:

Implement AJAX requests to handle adding new categories and saving selected categories without reloading the page.
Validation:

Ensure validation for category names and article content.
Conclusion
By integrating category management directly into the article creation and editing pages, 
and providing a dedicated category management page for more advanced tasks like reordering and deletion, 
you streamline the user experience. This approach makes it easier for the poster to manage their content effectively, 
reducing the need for navigation between different parts of the admin interface.
