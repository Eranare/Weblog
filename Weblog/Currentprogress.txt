ToDo:
- Create a writer role. we will have multiple article writers.
- reader accounts can sign up to become writer. give em a tos or some shit to verify before accepting them as a writer role.

- Users can subscribe to multiple writers, each writer will have their own subscription list. 
- Currency tracker for writer role? I guess we are tacking on a commission for the website. 5%. and then writers will pay for the payment processor commission themselves. 
- Writers can track income or some shit from their profile?...
- Seperate and change Admin dashboard to writer Dashboard.
- Make a proper profile page for writers and readers.
- Double check if categories and articles are linked properly.
- Article edit
- Article flag for deletion.
- Comments.
- Writers should have capability to hide comments on their articles i guess. or just save that for admin. 
- Report function for articles and comments. track reported comments and articles in admin panel. (allow admin to message writers regarding these things?) 
- currently the admin page is like my webshops dashboard. we can simplify that and the workflow for the user. 
- reader userprofile page. (subscriptions, edit user info, liked/favorite articles maybe?), if writer they will have a seperate panel above the standard nav bar. 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         

the ideal workflow for the owner would be. sign in and go to their site management page (either through the regular login or their own specific login route)
have a post a new article button
IDEALLY wed end up making like a mini html editor so that the owner can post images wherever they want in their blogpost, this also relies on fixing the storage stuff.
the user can on this new article page also select existing categories to tag this article with, or create new ones.
checkbox for is_premium.
hit post and the article would be posted

theyd have a seperate category management button. this would lead to a page where all current categories are listed and display how many articles are tied to each. 
any category should be deleteable. as they are tied through a junction table this should be possible even if a category is tied to articles (gl figuring out how to do that).
edit is also an option.




Reader workflow. 

home page loads on accessing the page. it should display a few most recent articles. maybe even include premium articles here but only previews.
clicking on an article allows a signed in user to read and post comments below it.  

They will also have the option to "upgrade" becoming a writer.
